# Fuck you
To whom reading this for what ever reason: 
If you think this code is "too functional" then you should fuck yourself, don't even talk to me, just fuck yourself. I don't have much to say with people don't even fucking know how good pure function can be.
If you think I apply the "wrong" design pattern then you should also fuck yourself, don't raise a PR, don't even write fucking code anymore. I don't have anything to say to people who don't respect DRY
